# Buildly React Template
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/buildlyio/buildly-react-template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/buildlyio/buildly-react-template) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/buildly-react-template/badge/?version=latest)](https://buildly-react-template.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Buildlyio/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/Buildlyio/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

Buildly React Template is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) web application that implements the core features of the UI core, pre-configure to connect to [Buildly Core](https://github.com/buildlyio/buildly-core).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The web application was tested and built with the following versions:

- node v16.14.2
- yarn v1.17.3

- You need to create .env.development.local file with the env variables (something as below).
buildly-react-template
|--.env.development.local

```
window.env={
    API_URL: "https://dev.example.com/",
    OAUTH_TOKEN_URL: "https://dev.example.com/oauth/token/",
    OAUTH_CLIENT_ID: "sjkghwty982092u1tjfwjit0348y82092utwgio",
    PRODUCTION: "false",
}
```

- In case you want to run https we app version on your local, you need to have a certificate created for your localhost already. Modify package.json file to indicate the path to you certififcate and key in the scripts --> https:local

### Installing

First of all, you need to have a Buildly Core instance up and running locally.
Further detail about how to deploy Buildly Core locally, check its [documentation](https://buildly-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

To install the application you need to download and install its dependencies, so you have to navigate to the project folder and run the following command:

```
$ yarn install
```

Now, initialize and build the project

```
$ yarn run build:local
```

To run the web app:

```
$ yarn run start:local
```

To run the https web app:

```
$ yarn run https:local
```

Your Buildly React Template will be running locally and listening to the port 3000, so you can access it via your browser typing this address: 127.0.0.1:3000

## Running the tests

To **run tests** using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/):

```
$ yarn run test
```

## Deployment

To deploy Buildly React Template on live, you can either use our [Buildly React Template Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/buildly/buildly-react-template) from Docker Hub or build your own image and host it somewhere, so it can be used with your deployment platform and/or tool.

### Build Docker image

First you need to have the web app dependencies installed and the app initialized locally.
And then you need to build it as a production application executing the following command:

```
$ yarn run build:prod
```

Now, you just need to build a Docker image and host it somewhere. Further info about how to build images, check Docker's [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).

### Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of Buildly React Template and their default values.  They can be updated in the
Docker container via flags as below or configured as environment variables in Travis.

|             Parameter               |            Description             |                    Default                |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `API_URL`                           | Buildly Core URL                   | ``      |
| `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`                   | The client identifier issued to the client during Buildly Core deployment  | `` |
| `OAUTH_TOKEN_URL`                   | Buildly Core URL used to authenticate users | `` |

Specify each parameter using `-e`, `--env`, and `--env-file` flags to set simple (non-array) environment variables to `docker run`. For example,

```bash
$ docker run -e MYVAR1 --env MYVAR2=foo \
    --env-file ./env.list \
    buildly/buildly-react-template
```
