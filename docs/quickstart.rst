Quickstart
==========

Excited to get start? This page gives a decent prologue to Buildly React Template. It assumes
you as of now have a Buildly Core instance up and running and also all the project's
prerequisites installed.

- node v16.14.2
- yarn v1.17.3

Installing
----------

Download and install web application dependencies running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   yarn install

Now, initialize and build the project

.. code-block:: bash
   
   yarn run build

To run the web app:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   yarn run start

your Buildy UI will be running locally and listening to the port 4200, so you can access
it via your browser typing this address: 127.0.0.1:4200

Running the tests
-----------------

To run tests using `Jest <https://jestjs.io/>`_: 

.. code-block:: bash
   
   yarn run test
